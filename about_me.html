    <p> Come day, I'm a barbeque prep cook supervisor at a local restaurant. Come night, I'm either: studying, playing
      music, sleeping, or getting mangled by cats and dogs. With a strong interest in music I have a deep passion for
      playing music, and appreciate passersby that take the time to listen. As a bass player I have been playing music
      for over 10 years, but that's not the only insturment that I am musically inclined on. I have been known to play
      drums, keyboards, guitar, and sing when I'm feeling up to it. It can all come together on Fruit Loops Studios when
      I am feeling funky. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 5%;"> That's not all that I do though. Ever since I was young, under ten, I have had a unique drive for technology and
      computers. Exploring them, trying to convince my parents to get a new phone so I could figure it out and toy with
      it. Although, I never really could convince them to acquire a mobile cell phone. The most type of coding I have
      done, is on myspace; creating a complicated profile that takes forever to load because you decided to try and make
      it overly fancy. I always thought it would be cool to mod games, and maybe recreate some old school games that had
      potential, but didn't make it.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 5%;">I aspire to achieve a lot during my learning process as a coder. I want it to take me to new accomplishments that
      I can be satisfied with. Find a new working force that will allow me to live a better life, and improve on my own
      self development, not only as a coder, but as a person.</p>
